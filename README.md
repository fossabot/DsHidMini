## Summary

DsHidMini is a self-contained, low footprint and
feature-rich [user-mode driver](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/overview-of-the-umdf) for
Microsoft Windows 10/11. It presents the controller as a configurable variety of fully standard-compliant HID devices to
the system and all games built on common APIs
like [DirectInput](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ee416842(v=vs.85)), [Raw Input](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/raw-input)
and the low-level [HID API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/hid/introduction-to-hid-concepts).
XInput-emulation further increases the support in modern games built with only Xbox controllers in mind. The driver
supports both wired connections by handling USB communication and wireless connections by building upon
the [BthPS3](https://github.com/nefarius/BthPS3) driver suite. An optional .NET configuration tool is provided to alter
driver behavior to fine-tune it to specific games or other use-cases.

## Features

- **Bluetooth support** if used in conjunction with [BthPS3](https://github.com/nefarius/BthPS3) (requires *at
  least* `v2.0.144` or newer)
- Automatically pairs the controller to Windows Bluetooth (if Bluetooth host radio is present)
- Multiple configurable HID Report Descriptors for wide range of compatibility
    - Single Gamepad device exposing all controls including **pressure sensitive buttons**
    - Split/multi device emulation to overcome DirectInput axis limits
    - Sony `sixaxis.sys` emulation (both wired **and wireless**)
    - **DualShock 4 emulation** for compatibility with [DS4Windows](https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows)
    - **Xbox Controller emulation** (XInput) for best compatibility with most modern games
- Quick disconnect (on Bluetooth) by pressing `L1 + R1 + PS` together for over one second
- Automatic disconnect (on Bluetooth) after idle timeout (5 minutes) expired to conserve battery
- Custom LED states indicate battery charge level
    - Wired: Charging will cycle through 1 to 4, if fully charged will stay on 4
    - Wireless: 4 = Full, 3 = High, 2 = Medium/low, 1 = Low/dying
- **Rumble exposure via Force Feedback**
    - The rumble motors are exposed as Force Feedback effects, allowing for great game compatibility
- Supports the [**PCSX2 PlayStation 2 Emulator**](https://pcsx2.net/)
    - Controller gets picked up by LilyPad plugin with all device features
- Supports the [**RPCS3 PlayStation 3 Emulator**](https://rpcs3.net/)
    - Controller gets picked up by DualShock 3 handler with all device features
- Supports [**DS4Windows**](https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows) (requires *at least* Version 2.2.10 or newer)
    - Controller gets presented as a DualShock 4 compatible variant
    - Read [#40](../../issues/40) for details about XInput and DS4 emulation
- Supports [**RetroArch**](https://www.retroarch.com/) emulation platform
- Supports [**x360ce**](https://www.x360ce.com/) for XInput emulation
- Supports [**Dolphin Emulator**](https://dolphin-emu.org/)
- Supports [**DuckStation - PlayStation 1, aka. PSX Emulator**](https://github.com/stenzek/duckstation)

## How it works

DsHidMini is a filter driver sitting below `mshidumdf.sys` and acts as a function driver for USB and Bluetooth through
the [User-mode Driver Framework Reflector](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/detailed-view-of-the-umdf-architecture),
handling translation of incoming HID I/O traffic to underlying USB/Bluetooth I/O and vice versa. On USB it replaces the
Windows stock drivers for the Sony hardware and presents the device as a variety of user-configurable HID devices (see
documentation). On Bluetooth in conjunction with BthPS3 it replaces the need
for [Shibari](https://github.com/nefarius/Shibari) as the driver directly communicates over wireless channels and takes
care of the necessary translation logic. As a user-mode driver it has limited access to the registry, therefore
device-specific settings are stored and retrieved using
the [Unified Device Property Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/unified-device-property-model--windows-vista-and-later-)
API. Most of the core HID heavy lifting is done by the
amazing [DMF_VirtualHidMini](https://github.com/microsoft/DMF/blob/master/Dmf/Modules.Library/Dmf_VirtualHidMini.md)
module which greatly reduced the need for boilerplate code and sped up development tremendously.

## Environment

DsHidMini components (drivers, utilities) are designed for **Windows 10**, version 1809 or newer (x86, x64).

The dependencies used in DsHidMini don't exist in Windows 7/8/8.1 so they can't be supported.

## How to build

### Prerequisites

- [Step 1: Install Visual Studio 2022](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk#download-icon-step-1-install-visual-studio-2022)
- [Step 2: Install Windows 11, version 22H2 SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk#download-icon-step-2-install-windows-11-version-22h2-sdk)
- [Step 3: Install Windows 11, version 22H2 WDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk#download-icon-step-3-install-windows-11-version-22h2-wdk)
- [Step 4: Clone the Driver Module Framework (DMF)](https://github.com/microsoft/DMF) into the same parent directory.
    - **Important:** requires *at least* [`v1.1.83`](https://github.com/microsoft/DMF/releases/tag/v1.1.83) or newer
    - Build the `DmfU` project with Release and Debug configurations for all architectures (x64 and Win32).

You can build individual projects of the solution within Visual Studio.
